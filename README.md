# CWorld - Physics engine implemented in C

I decided to implement my own physics engine in C.  
I think we should have a good quality, well maintained, properly licenced library for games and simulations.

A good use case would be combining with SDL2.

You maybe wonder, there's no C physics engines already?  
Well not a lot, and not quite:
* [Chipmunk2D](https://github.com/slembcke/Chipmunk2D) is not maintained for 3 years,
and kind of feel like too much.
* [Box2D](https://github.com/erincatto/box2d) is C++ based.
* [Bullet](https://github.com/bulletphysics/bullet3) maintained, but C++ as well.

## Used Libraries

* Vector Container: [eteran/c-vector](https://github.com/eteran/c-vector)
* Vector Math: [felselva/mathc](https://github.com/felselva/mathc)

**Currently, this engine is _under development_, and should not be used for _production_!**
